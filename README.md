## Development

We need `Node.js` to build and manage dependencies, so make sure you have installed `Node.js` before getting started.

```bash
# Install the dependencies
$ npm install

# Start the server
$ npm start

# Build production (find production version in `dist` folder)
$ npm run build

# Start development server
$ npm run dev-server
```
